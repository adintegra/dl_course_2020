# Deep Learning (CAS machine intelligence, 2020) 

This course in deep learning focuses on practical aspects of deep learning. We therefore provide jupyter notebooks ([complete overview of all notebooks](https://github.com/tensorchiefs/dl_course_2020/tree/master/notebooks) used in the course).

For doing the hands-on part on your own computer you can either install anaconda ([details and installation instruction](anaconda.md)) or use the provided a docker container ([details and installation instruction](docker.md)).

To easily follow the course please make sure that you are familiar with the some [basic math and python skills](prerequistites.md). 

## Info for the projects
You can join together in small groups and choose a topic for your DL project. You should prepare a poster and a spotlight talk (5 minutes) which you will present on the last course day. To get some hints how to create a good poster you can check out the links that are provided in <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/u1f6mqk4pc3uhxe/poster-guidelines.pdf?dl=1">poster_guidelines.pdf</a> 

If you need free GPU resources, we might want to follow the [instructions how to use google colab](co.md). Help for preparing a hdf5 file from your images you can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/tensorchiefs/dl_course_2018/blob/master/notebooks/data_prep.ipynb"> example Notebook.</a> 

Examples for projects from the DL course 2018 and 2019 can be found [here](projects.md).

## Other resources
We took inspiration (and sometimes slides / figures) from the following resources.

* Deep Learning Book (DL-Book) [http://www.deeplearningbook.org/](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/). This is a quite comprehensive book which goes far beyond the scope of this course.

* Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition [http://cs231n.stanford.edu/](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/), has additional material and [youtube videos of the lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC). While the focus is on computer vision, it also treats other topics such as optimization, backpropagation and RNNs. Lecture notes can be found at [http://cs231n.github.io/](http://cs231n.github.io/).

* More TensorFlow examples can be found at [dl_tutorial](https://github.com/oduerr/dl_tutorial/tree/master/tensorflow/) 

* Another applied course in DL: [TensorFlow and Deep Learning without a PhD](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2017/01/learn-tensorflow-and-deep-learning-without-a-phd)

## Dates 
The course is split in 8 sessions, each 4 lectures long.
